# Decompilation progress

Written by `tools/progress.py --write PROGRESS.md` from `hooks/pre-commit`; do not edit.
A function counts as done when its file is marked `complete` in `delinks.txt`, so the
build links it from `src/`. Functions written as `asm` inside a .c file count separately.

## Totals

| Code | Functions in C | Bytes in C | % of bytes | Functions in asm | Bytes in asm |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| game | 191 / 6603 | 27188 / 1531944 | 1.77% | 0 | 0 |
| SDK/library | 1 / 880 | 40 / 154050 | 0.03% | 1 | 30 |
| all | 192 / 7483 | 27228 / 1685994 | 1.61% | 1 | 30 |

## By module

Rows with nothing done are left out, but count in the totals.
